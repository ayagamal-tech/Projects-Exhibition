#A
The pulse sensor works by emitting an Infra-Red signal from an IR-Diode onto the skin. 
Just underneath the skin, there are capillaries carrying blood.
Every time heartpumps there is a small increase in blood flow/pressure.
This swells the capillariesslightly, this slightly more filled capillary reflects more infra-red than at times when theheart is not giving your blood a “push”.
An Infra-detector on the device senses thedifferent reflected IR levels.
Some simple comparator circuitry converts this into avoltage signal which we can read with the Arduino Analog inputs.
#B
The code reads a character value from a Bluetooth device, and based on the received command, it controls the car's movement.
The code starts with defining the pins used to control the car's motors.
Then, in the setup function, it sets the defined pins as output pins and starts the serial communication.
In the loop function, the code waits for incoming data from the Bluetooth device.
Once a character is available, it is stored in the variable "cmd".
Then, the code checks the value of "cmd" and executes the corresponding action.
#C
the sensor checks if anybody front of the door and the user enters the password if he is an admin he can change the password n
or can use the frid to open the door more quick.
#D
This is a security system that triggers an alarm when an intruder or unauthorized individual enters the premises.
The alarm will not cease until the owner inputs a password to deactivate it.
Subsequently, another password must be entered to reset the system and restore its original state.
#E
Our project is glasses for the blind it will help them to walk in the street or anywhere without a need to help.
It starts working by sensing a body at a distance 1 Metre away, then a sound will warn them to stop or take care about whichever coming.
